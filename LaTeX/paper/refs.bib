@inproceedings{North2005,
abstract = {Repast is a widely used free and open-source agent-based modeling and simulation toolkit. Three Repast platforms are currently available, namely, Repast for Java (Repast J), Repast for the Microsoft .NET framework (Repast .NET), and Repast for Python Scripting (Repast Py). Each of these platforms has the same core features. However, each platform provides a different environment for these features. Taken together, the Repast platform portfolio gives modelers a choice of model development and execution environments. Repast Simphony (Repast S) extends the Repast portfolio by offering a new approach to simulation development and execution. The Repast S runtime is designed to include advanced features for agent storage, display, and behavioral activation, as well as new facilities for data analysis and presentation. This paper introduces the architecture and core features of the Repast S runtime system and discusses how Repast S fits within the larger Repast portfolio. A related paper in this Agent 2005 conference proceedings by the same authors, Repast Simphony Development Environment, discusses the Repast S model authoring system.},
